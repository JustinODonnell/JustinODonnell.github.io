# Is this an image? Or is it a gun?



With just a few lines of code, the above image can be converted back into the STL files for the Liberator, a 3D-printable gun created by Defense Distributed.

This project is meant to remind politicians, bureaucrats, and busy-bodies everywhere that attempting to restrict distribution of code is both pragmatically preposterous and a violation of free speech.

For bonus points, this file was also uploaded to [LBRY](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry), ensuring that a record of it persists via blockchain.

## Usage

### Packing

`php pack.php <filepath>`

This will create a PNG at `<filename>.png`.

### Unpacking

`php unpack.php <imagepath>`

This will take a PNG located at `<imagepath>` and turn it back into the source file.
